    name: "Pachisi",
    description:
      "Pachisi is one of the oldest known board games, believed to have originated in ancient India. It is played on a cross-shaped board using cowrie shells as dice and cloth tokens. Players race their tokens around the board to reach the center, encountering challenges based on dice rolls. Strategy and chance go hand in hand, requiring players to block opponents and avoid being captured. The game was popular in royal courts and inspired many modern versions, including Ludo. Played in teams or individually, it encourages critical thinking and tactical movement. Its cultural roots are deep, symbolizing aspects of Indian tradition and storytelling.",

    description:
      "Chaupar, similar to Pachisi, is an ancient Indian board game played with cross-shaped boards and long dice called 'pasa'. It was a favorite among kings and nobles, especially during the Mughal era. The game involves moving pieces based on dice rolls, with the goal of reaching the central square first. It encourages planning and unpredictability due to its unique dice system. Chaupar also appears in Indian epics like the Mahabharata, where a game sets off major events in the story. It combines chance and intellect, requiring players to be both cautious and bold. Often handcrafted, Chaupar boards hold artistic and cultural significance.",

    name: "Gilli Danda",
    description:
      "Gilli Danda is a traditional outdoor game, widely played in Indian villages. It involves two sticks: a long one called 'danda' and a shorter one called 'gilli'. The gilli is flicked into the air using the danda and then struck again to send it flying. The aim is to hit it as far as possible and score runs based on distance. Often compared to modern baseball or cricket, it relies heavily on hand-eye coordination and reflexes. No formal equipment is required, making it accessible and loved by children. The game promotes physical fitness, agility, and timing. It is a symbol of childhood nostalgia for many Indians.",

      "Kabaddi is a high-intensity contact sport that blends strength, strategy, and endurance. Originating in ancient India, it involves two teams taking turns sending a 'raider' into the opponent’s half to tag players and return safely.

    description:
      "Chaturanga is the ancient Indian precursor to modern chess, dating back to around the 6th century CE. It was originally played on an 8x8 board and represented the four divisions of an army: infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots. These evolved into modern-day pawns, knights, bishops, and rooks. The game was about strategy, foresight, and planning, often seen as a royal pastime. It spread from India to Persia and later to Europe, where it developed into the chess we know today. Chaturanga teaches critical thinking and decision-making. Its legacy shows India’s influence on global intellectual games and traditions.",
